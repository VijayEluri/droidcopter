Flies a quadrocopter from an android-based phone.

Package has six main components: ChopperStatus maintains
updated information on status readings from various sensors, Comm handles text communications with the control
server, Guidance handles absolute motor speed, MakePicture captures telemetry from the camera, Navigation
handles autopilot routines, and TransmitPicture handles the transmission of telemetry to the control server.
These classes are all either Runnables or themselves Threads, and exactly one instance of each should be run
at a time.
<p>
Task scheduling and inter-thread communication is handled with the Handler class.
<p>
Many fields/objects are shared between threads.  In almost every case, only a single thread will ever
write to a shared field/object, though many may read from that data.  Furthermore, many threads are
time-sensitive: a delay in execution may result in catastrophic hardware failure.  Consequently, a
collection of ReentrantLocks are used to ensure that all read/writes of shared data either are atomic or 
do not take place at all.  Shared data that are inherently atomic usually have no associated lock; shared
data that are not usually do.  As a rule, time-sensitive threads that only read from shared data use the
tryLock() method; it is often better to use old data than to suspend execution to wait for a lock.  Threads
that write to a shared field, however, usually use the lock() method to ensure that accurate data is ultimately
recorded.
